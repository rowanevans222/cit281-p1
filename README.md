# CIT 281 Project 1

This project introduced me to using the Command Line Interface (CLI), Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and Node.js to work with files and create basic JavaScript programs.

### ðŸ”§ Skills and Tools Used:
- Command Line Interface (Windows/macOS)
- Visual Studio Code
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- File and folder manipulation

### ðŸ§  What I Did:
- Used CLI to create a custom folder structure and capture it with screenshots
- Practiced using `ping` and learned how to stop processes using keyboard interrupts
- Created and executed two JavaScript programs:
  - One that prints the current day of the week using an array and a one-liner solution
  - One that generates a random lowercase string of 5â€“25 characters and shows the count

This was a foundational project that helped me get comfortable navigating my systemâ€™s terminal and working with JavaScript outside of a web browser.
